# Initial ideas

Initially 2 games

## Math operations

The user needs to evaluate a result of a expression with random numbers. After each right response, we increase the number of numbers. I think initially in select random operations between "+" and "-". Why not "/". Because if we dont select the number to divide carrefuly, maybe the result will be a fractional number. Why not "*". Because the expression maybe will be too complex with a multiplication of a number with 2 digits, like 6234 * 77.

Example (random numbers):

```
55 + 12

(right user answer)
(next request)
77 + 2 - 14

(right user answer)
(next request)
99 - 3 - 30 + 8 

(wrong user answer)
(next request)
55 + 22 - 44 + 17
```

I only started the structure of this challenge, installed the dependencies etc.

## Colors and texts

We can create a text if a name of a random color and a color. But only in one case the match is right.

I didn't start the development of this challenge.
